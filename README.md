Queues are linear data structures based on the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, used in real-life scenarios like supermarket waiting lines. They are commonly used in operating systems, networking and even event handling for scheduling processes.
A queue and a doubly linked list are linear data structures, with a queue designed for fast and easy insertion and deleting operations, as doubly linked list allows bidirectional movement .
Queues are preferred over other data structures for tasks that require specific order, such as task scheduling in operating systems, printing queue management in printers and taking care of  requests in web servers. When choosing between a queue and other data structures, consider the order of elements and use other structures like stacks or priority queues for different priorities.
Queue implementation can be done using array or linked list data structures. Arrays offer constant time access but can be costly to resize. Linked lists allow dynamic memory distribution and are suitable for queues without resizing. The choice depends on the application's requirements, with arrays preferred for known queue size and memory efficiency, and linked lists for flexibility in dynamic sizes and insertions/deletions.
